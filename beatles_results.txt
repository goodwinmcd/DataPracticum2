BY ANDREW Last night, I had the pleasure of two very special friends. One was a banker with a motorcar,
And the other a gardener with a motorcar.
He was very pleased to be here
And he and I had a good time
The two of us had a good time
Till a bridge had been built
Over our heads We sat on a rock
Set our eyes on the sky
And studied the sky
Over our heads And when we said "Goodbye", we parted ways
And hewed us a cordially
A costly mistake had occurred
That could not be corrected
We had just witnessed a wedding
And we would be honored to know that it was here
That we would be happy
And that it was in us to worry
He assured us that his life was on the line
And that he would keep us updated On his way back home He has just returned from a trip to the mines
Where explosives have been left
And he is met with a standing ovation.
He is so full of himself
That he forgets what he's doing
And hete no one so full
That he lets us in He leads the way with his guitar
He sings a song that I will sing
And he will lead the way Once there was a way,
To get back homeward,
Once there was a way,
To get back home
Sleep pretty darling do not cry
and I will sing a lullaby Golden slumbers fill your eyes,
smiles awake you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling do not cry,
and I will sing a lullaby Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time I never give you my pillow,
I only send you my invitations
And in the middle of the celebrations,
I break down Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time
Boy you're gonna carry that weight,
carry that weight for a long time Oh yeah, all right,

Looking up at the stars. In my hour of darkness

Looking up at the stars. In my hour of darkness
I take a drink and I feel the wind blow
I know I can't be found

I take a smoke and I feel the wind blow
I know I can't be found
In my hour of darkness Oh, every day for the past three weeks
I have the pleasure of his hair,
His eyes are blue
And we speak in a low voice He says he wants to hold the wedding day
betrothal party
Outdoors
To himself
And in the pouring rain He drags a carton of honey
Intakes himself from the table
Drives off in his limousine
Puts his hands up in the air
Somebody calls the police, but I they come right by
Owww!
They get the girl, the guy Who made the news last week
(She love him, she love him, she love him)
(She love him, she love him, she love him)
They have to be safe
And I need my girl, the kind of girl
You want so much it make you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
Still you don't regret a single day You feel that something is missing

If you see me at all
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade I'd you know I'd like to be under the sea
I'd make you dream
Look at you all see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
Look at you all
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade
I'd like to be under the sea
In an octopus' garden in the shade Oh yeah, all right
Are you gonna be in my dreams tonight? Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you And in the end, the love you take
Is equal to the love you make I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure
If he was from the House of Lords I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
Somebody spoke and I went into a dream I read the news today, oh boy
Four thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on Michelle, ma belle
These are words that go together well
My Michelle
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I love you, I love you, I love you
That's all I want to say
Until I find a way
I will say the only words I know that you'll understand Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
I need to, I need to, I need to
I need to make you see
Oh, what you mean to me
Until I do, I'm hoping you will know what I mean
I love you... I want you, I want you, I want you
I think you know by now
I'll get to you somehow
Until I do, I'm telling you so you'll understand
Michelle, ma belle
Sont les mots qui vont tres bien ensemble
Tres bien ensemble
And I will say the only words I know that you'll understand
My Michelle Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know.
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say "Hello". On the corner is a banker with a motorcar,
And little children laugh at him behind his back.
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain, very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass,
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen.
He likes to keep his fire engine clean,
It's a clean machine. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
A four of fish and finger pies
In summer. Meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of the roundabout
The pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray.
And though she feels as if she's in a play,
She is anyway. In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer,
We see the banker sitting waiting for a trim,
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain - very strange. Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back.
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny Lane! Jojo was a man who thought he was a loner
But he knew it wouldn't last
Jojo left his home in Tucson, Arizona

 loud I sit,
On the way in two
Two and two are living
One is dead And in the middle of the celebrations,
is the fireman,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We sing a lullaby Golden slumbers,
Spill yourself still more
You're gonna need it all the time
If you want it all the time,
You just need the love of your heart
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
Love you, love you, love you, love you, love you
And, in The End, do not cry
Because I can't be loved
When I have read your song
I'm not certain
How long ago today's incident
Began?
Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. I have never known
The like of this, I've been alone
And I have missed things
And kept out of sight
But other girls were never quite
Like this, di-di-di-di'n'di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Yeah!
Bup-a-lup-bup! Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. I've just seen a face,
I can't forget the time or place
Where we just met.
She's just the girl for me
And I want all the world to see
We've met, mm-mm-mm-di-di-di. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Oh, falling, yes I am falling,
And she keeps calling
Me back again. Imagine there's no heaven
It's easy if you try
No hell below us
Above us only sky
Imagine all the people
Living for today... Imagine there's no countries
It isn't hard to do

And no religion, too Imagine all the people
Living life in peace You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will be as one Imagine no possessions
I wonder if you can
No need for greed or hunger
A brotherhood of man Imagine all the people
Sharing all the world You, you may say I'm a dreamer
But I'm not the only one
I hope someday you will join us
And the world will live as one The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to you door The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Any way you'll never know
The many ways I've tried But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door But still they lead me back
To the long winding road
You left me waiting here
A long long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your door Oh, I need your love, babe
Guess you know it's true
Hope you need my love babe
Just like I need you Hold me, love me, hold me, love me
