======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 time in the morning and then I fall asleep and I woke up that morning and he ran for mayor
He's white, he's a millionaire, he signed his contract and he's a millionaire
Yeah you bet, Kim, but you ain't white
You're stuck in a white van, with the windows up
And noiselessly looking down at the sky
You can't see, you can only smell the wind
And you can't make that big a dent in the ground
Cause you're only feet from me now
Yeah look at my shoes, they was S'mem shoes
Maybe I should've pulled a stunt
Instead of just sitting on the porch with that stupid Tommy Hilcher tape
Cause I'd knock your trailer out and roast your place
So you might wanna try something
And I ain't gotta stop the flow
Cause your stomachs are growing impatient
And your spirits are light
Cause you can't grow dry feetin' this shit
Plus you're starting to feel like a snobby model
Plus you feel like Elway when you're dehydrated
So they call me the K-Fed
Yeah you're right, they changed my whole outlook
Plus you feel like a fan when you hear I'm bald
Plus you know the song by Phil Collins When I was growing up, there wasn't a thing called rap
There wasn't a word that was legal tender
Drugs didn't even exist in elementary school
Nobody gave a shit about verse 1
And verse 7 got even keeled
You were prepared to do some brutal harm to these lil' bastards
Now I don't mean to be mean but fuck it
I risked a career blow my brains out
Me and Eminem were sitting at the table talking
I take it you took it into consideration
That you were to be his bodyguard while he slept with fellow soldier
So how did it go that we ended up in this fucking ditch
So I took it upon myself to clean up the mess I'd made
Once I to lay it and make some new friends
I'd be lying if I didn't credit Jade Helm with saving my life
I've risked a career blow my brains out
Me and Eminem were sitting at the table talking
I take it you took it upon yourself to tear it up
Well I think you have just entered the next catacly
Complex where you take great pleasure in lampooning a niggas civilian
Dawthon see I love my enemy
Bout time to show off my enormous cage
And give him the motherfuckin' breast
And bask in the fact that I'm not as ridiculous as you thought I was
Ironic parading a brutalized version of myself
Now you can take your hands off the table
And put your girlfriend up front
And let me know that your stepson isn't wearing
Now let's just pretend that this is an episode now
You still ain't gotten over the fact that I ain't as insane as you thought
I still think you're insane my lady you're amazing
And if you had the balls to rip the program
Show me where you were once you was
And I would never again condone what you did
How could you let this celebrity continue to grow
And how could he be so out in public
That you let yourself go without saying a word
And I don't know how you could ever be as big of a fan as he
I think he's sick of you but for the love of god
Give him the ball and go after the messenger
When you're caught sending amped bombs of smoke
Smoke you're returning fire from where you were
And you were sending amped messages to deign to explode
And just know there's a way out
And whatever may yet lurk in the grass, weeds or flowers
Feel free to touch my body with your tongue
But remember, it's a beautiful thing
One moment you're gross and the next you're beautiful
Work with me and you'll never tire
Your energy is spreading like wild fire
You reach for my onion rings to your temple
'Cause life throws fits and it's rare that I get burned
But I'm lucky enough to be the only one that gets the hell outta
My thoughts are with my own hands and emotions come to life
Even when the blows are violent
I'm still as calm and rational as I ever was
My thoughts are with my own hands and emotions come to life
Even when the blows are violent I'm still as calm and rational as I ever was
My thoughts are with my own hands and emotions come to mind
When I'm reminiscing how I was when I was just a babe
When I was in my late thirties and fuzzy afternoons
It's a different baby, how can I look youthful?
Young people don't get it, they think I'm 'bout 'till I die
What? Fifteen

======== SAMPLE 1 ========
 you'm really making this up with my own eyes
But as time passes, things get bizarre
Look at how much smoke we're breathing
How many times we reloaded at a time
How many clips of our a-t-f's stay in the knee-highs
And stomachs are stuffed with chicken, ham and Italian sausage
Now how the fuck am I supposed to get from Bozo to you just cause of the way I am?
I didn't have to, I-I-I hear them little 'emings, they're so similar
I-I-I hear them motherfuckers'es voices, and they think it's cool
I go to college and get a GMC (General Motors Corporation)
Holland get an Audi (A-Tron), then some Beys
An Alf-Ain who can make me a lyin' dang CD
Khalil get an Alf-A-Tron, then we can hop on each other's dick
Here, bum bum comes here, bum bum goes there
Hailie, you can suck my dick, guess what I'm a callin' it
Did you really think I'm a G-I-A-S-Song?
No?
Why do we call you D12?
Why do we put your number on it
It might stop you from getting an Alf-Ain
From now on, we gonna Put Your Name On It
I'm gonna put yours on it
Yeah, call me Charlie
I'm gonna put yours on it
I'm livin' life in the fast lane
You know what I mean?
I'm like your troubles woman
I cover up with a comfy couch
Look baby there's somethin' I wanna talk to you about
Girls like you don't wanna hear it
I admit, I know you feel that too
Just curious...
What's it been like for you and Amy
Both experiencing discrimination
And yet you're able to lay claim to one another
It's been a rollercoaster ride for us
But I guess the more baggage we have
The sooner we pull through
It's so crazy what we can out of our misery
So teary see that fuckin' Steven Seagal kinda shit every so often
That makes me sad, more than anything
I just can't seem to get up
'Cause I'm too busy fighting off the hiss
'Cause these doc dont even bother saying meds
So that if it all goes through then I can just drop the mic
And just make my voice heard
I hope that no one in particular I've offended
Has a right to sound angry
Shit, why would I? My defenses are so up
And down, daddy's a battlin' asshole
Now I know why he or she screams that
And why they need one more time
Call me Mr. FEMALE, just try to remember which toy girly
Which shows which season which am I
Which makes me less of a villain
And why I still got a long way to go
To tell my story, really, let's try to tell it
In a way that feels real, isn't it?
So let's go, ho! I'm- I- I- I- I- I- I- I- New York Times best-selling author, health food brand
Makes you sick option, doesn't it?
Retards, sick people guide you to a hellish world
Brainwashed, you think your shit'lllast forever?
Now scientists have shown that
You've been converted to the habit of sodomising
Kid who uses taking his own life into his own (he's infesting his home)
Dr Andrew Wakefield, sound enough to strangle your infant (baby)
Make noise like a scientist, and risk it, your (rinse) canal burst
sound like a gunshot wound to your head
your (white noise) self sounds like a warning to the world
and toads grow up to become the modern-day Genghis Khan
warnin' would-be conquerors
Would be nice to see a movie on the evils
And the Patriots' haters went wack on the humble
and today's (patriot) outweighing the demonic
ipotentiaries of (white noise)
brings up (inflammation) ya God thou art nigh 3 million years old
You can't raise a living being through struggle
Instead of fleece
You aint hole,you're gonna need toa collapsed
I-I-I-I hear voices over my PA
They say her alarm is going off
Oh my God she's dead
Can you hear me?
They don't know what kind of noise we make
We just enjoy confusing noise with strength
We feel strong enough to go for a woman and she doesn't seem to be alright

 as a cipher
You always say I'm lucky
cause back then I can still blow pills now yourivbits
I know you want me baby now
I know you want me baby Now don't you just be grossed out
Baby you're thinking I don't know
Why am I here in the first place?
Why is my brain racing after me?
I came to take you with me Now I'm gonna take each baby girl and pair 'em all up
And take each one of them to yet another party This is survival of the fittest You really wanna fit me into this space?
Let me see what I can find within this space
Nothing, I really can't see anything
Except for a tired, stressed, scared out 'er I'm just gonna stand there and watch
Like a fucking game of ping pong with no balls
Is it too late to start over?
Or am I just gonna grow hungrier and further
Admittedly, I know better than to take care of my own
So here's what I just wrote (ninth base, nyack, top)
Look, I'm totally behind you little bitch
You're never gonna be as quick as I thought
And I ain't feel no shame no more
I'm just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Like a burnt down house,
Like a ruined house,
No more signs of gonna happen
Except for a moan from somewhere quiet
I'm still inside the club
Packing even after fucking Acme
Just to see what these kids gonna feel
Just like when I appeared on 'em
Just a bunch of gibberish
Then I got sloppy, slouchy and breadlite
And everything but the most die-offs
Should be enough to keep me one of the lefties I can be witty
Tongue its nonsense cut, started and ended
Grow tired of waiting and something must have goin'
For me to just fall back and act immature
Instead of tryin' to strike a chord I's been honing my game
I can make a be a flunky, cut every word
But by the time the verses started rolling
I ain't even gotta keep two still
I'm honing my game so the more verse verses I I can
Make me a play for the loose leafy lane
Of the neighborhood where you pee you're immediately identifiable
As if you were kissing me
And I swear to God that I'll be the man no matter what
I'm from the '80s, '90s Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got something to say
But nothing comes out when they move their lips
Just a bunch of gibberish
And motherfuckers act like they forgot about Dre So what do you say to someone you hate
Or anyone tryna bring trouble your way
Wanna resolve things in a bloodier way
Then just study a tape of N.W.A
One day I was walking by
With a Walkman on
When I caught a guy
Give me an awkward eye
And I strangled him up in the parking lot
With his Karl Kani
He said he's from Sweden
I told him I'd be the man to rock him
But he left me the next day
With a big ol' dick dangling
I told Karl I'd shave his beard and start over
So I cut him out with S's and a C
A Fist full of fizzles sings Yella sing the song
After that you know nothing happens
In the real world
When you turn on the TV and just talk
Just know that I'm just another one e watching
Sometimes I get so mad I almost kill and hide
The bitches don't know what's funny
They keep asking me why I let these bitches keep on talking
I wanna make a reality TV show about my life
The crazy shit they hear, I go crazy
They call me the bard
And I sing in the chorus
About money, fame, love, fuckin' a motherfuckin' bitch
And I'm on holiday in Norway
And meet a really nice fellow named
Vincent
But he's a prick, he tried to touch me
He tried to touch me on some dates
But he got a you know, Teddy bear under his wing
And he tried to take my girl
By the time they got to the hospital, I would be 32
I would have died a infantately
Though I was just born, I'm so pathetically young
I think about my shitty lives everyday I just do not
This shit will never work in real life,
I would have to be a genius to get it
And I would sooner die than watch

what this boy's fussin' is real
He's lookin' around this club don't you think?
Why him back? why him ass, motherfucker think?
Why him? his genes are fucked up cause his daddy's sayin' there's a problem
Fuck that, crack that, let him go slack
Till he hurls his load all the way to the roof I ain't bustin' it, he ain't makin' a sound
Like damn near I'm dangling
Like a fucking cross between a fucking banner and a pole
I'm cross between a fucking pole and a nine
I'm cross between a fucking torch and a curtain
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a single wire
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a six
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a three
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a two
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a one
I'm cross between a fucking candle and a ninja dog spirit my heart is a slow burn
It's about getting there, wanting to be there
You stop breathing, you stop walking
You stop talking, you stop breathing
It's like your soul's in my truck
Listen up, I'm in your grill, we're cooking
I'm relishing the challenge, my Shelby brothers
It's getting to the point, I'm exhausted
My blood pressure's just a percent above me
I'm nervous, I'm nervous, I'm murdering people
It's look who's eating dinner, I'm seein' them wobble
Brenda means the world to me, she's unfriendly
I get so drunk I almost killed Nate Dogg, she's unfriendly
I don't know dude, I don't know what kind of guy you are Nate, what you wanna see?
I'll show you Hell
I'll show you hell
Hell will be what it is You're such a fuckin' bum! I'm so bummed out I can't stand you
Come to think about, we took the limo, called Nate's number and sat outside it
And wrote a song about it, kinda like a rap cause we were just like

Give me a pat on the back?
Whatever works for me, works for you
Got some shit that you'd like to boast?
Come to think about, we took your cash
And took your fucking hands off of you
Got some shit you admired?
Lick your fucking lips, just nibble on his stubble
We don't rock the boat much (oh)
Don't pirate music for pay, I don't know how many times I rock
But I know once I ripped your lips out
Said fuck it, I'ma get you a pint
Unless you come try to cash me in
Give me a blow-up dolly for Christmas
We light up like we's the ones who lights the school
We act like we want to forever infatuation
I suppose I am his cause he's made to live by the rules
But I find myself getting more and more irritated
Over and over again, how the fuck can he get away with it?
Even after getting it, he still don't give a shit
Even tryin' to cash me in
Even if I leave his fuckin' mind in, how did he get here?
Even if I ran, I'da murdered you
If I be blew out, you would've stayed in
